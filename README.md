# Quadtree-visualisation
## [Live-Link](quadtree-collision-detection.netlify.app)
This repository is about the visualisation of Quadtree and how it segments 2-D space into various segments when more than the allowed number of points are added in a space

## Features
-**Construction**: Build the quadtree by drawing points on the canvas
-**Query Search**: Search a square region for points inside it
-**Collision Detection Visualisation**: Real time efficient collion-detection visualised by quadtree
